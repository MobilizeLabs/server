COLLABORATION POLICY:

Please avoid pushing to master. Instead, please push to a development branch.


CODING STANDARDS:

4 space indents (no tabs)

Always use curly braces even if the conditional or loop is one line

Opening curly braces go on the same line of the loop or conditional declaration

Comments anywhere can only be 80 chars per line

For code, most of us have been going with 80 chars per line, but that is not a hard and fast rule.
