The AndWellness server project. All server source code, scripts, database configuration files, thirdparty applications, and the visualizations live in this repo.

To deploy the server application itself do the following:

1) Build the server with ant.
    "ant clean dist -f <build-no_ssl.xml | build-ssl.xml>"
    
2) Stop the server if it is currently running.
    "/opt/aw/as/bin/asd.sh stop"

3) Destroy the existing server app if it exists.
    "rm -fv /opt/aw/as/webapps/app.war"
    "rm -rfv /opt/aw/as/webapps/app/"

4) Copy the newly built WAR file from the dist directory into the webapps directory.
    "cp </server/project/directory/dist/newly-built-war-file.war> /opt/aw/as/webapps/app.war"
    
5) Start the server.
    "/opt/aw/as/bin/asd.sh start"
