The ohmage server project. All server source code and database configuration files live in this repo.

To deploy the server application itself do the following:

1) Build the server with ant.
    "ant clean dist"
    
2) Stop the server if it is currently running.
    "/opt/aw/as/bin/asd.sh stop"

3) Destroy the existing server app if it exists.
    "rm -fv /opt/aw/as/webapps/app.war"
    "rm -rfv /opt/aw/as/webapps/app/"

4) Copy the newly built WAR file from the dist directory into the webapps directory.
    "cp dist/<WAR file> /opt/aw/as/webapps/app.war"
    
5) Start the server.
    "/opt/aw/as/bin/asd.sh start"
