### Upload Survey Responses

Saves one or more survey responses for a single user.

#### Path

    /surveys/<survey_id>/<survey_version>/data

#### Parameters

None. An authentication token must be present in the HTTP headers.

#### Request Body

The request body is a multi-part form POST containing one or many parts. One part must be a JSON array of JSON objects representing survey responses. Any other part must be an attached file containing one of the allowed media types (audio, image, video).

##### Survey Upload JSON Format

Each survey response is represented an object that must contain a metadata object and a data object. 

##### Metadata

| Key | Description | Required | Format 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | A client-generated ID. This ID must be unique for the user-survey ID-survey version triple. | Yes | Any string.
| `timestamp` | A timestamp that indicates the time at which this survey response was generated on the client. The timestamp must be one of the [W3C formats of the ISO8601 date standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime). | No | A valid W3C ISO8601 timestamp.
| `timestamp_millis` | The number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch indicating when this survey response was generated on the client. | No | A long.
| `location` | A JSON object containing location information. | No | A valid location object. See the following table.

###### Location

| Key | Description | Required | Format 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `latitude` | The latitude at which this point was generated. | Yes | A double representing a valid latitude. 
| `longitude` | The longitude at which this point was generated. | Yes | A double representing a valid longitude. 
| `accuracy` | The accuracy in meters of this latitude-longitude pair. | Yes | A double. 
| `time` | The number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch indicating when this location was generated on the client. | Yes | A double. 

##### Data

A JSON object containing responses for the survey definition identified by survey ID-version pair in the URI path to this request. The JSON object is a series of key-value pairs where each key is a `survey_item_id` and its value is a valid value for the ID's `survey_item_type`.

###### General Rules

If a `survey_item` is marked as `skippable` and the user skipped the survey, the survey item should not be included in the upload. The server application will set the value as skipped if necessary.

If a `survey_item` was not displayed to the user because it contained a condition that evaluated to false, the survey item should not be included in the upload. The server application will set the value as not displayed if necessary.

###### Specific Survey Item Types

| Type | Value |
| --- | --- | 
| `message` | No response should be included in the data object. |
| `audio_prompt` | A string ID unique to this survey upload which must equal a filename present in one of the multipart parts. |
| `image_prompt` | A string ID unique to this survey upload which must equal a filename present in one of the multipart parts. |
| `video_prompt` | A string ID unique to this survey upload which must equal a filename present in one of the multipart parts. |
| `number_prompt` | A number between `min` and `max` inclusive if min and max are defined for the survey item. Must be a whole number if `whole_numbers_only` is true. |
| `remote_activity_prompt` | A JSON object which must adhere to the Concordia schema defined for the remote activity. |
| `number_single_choice_prompt` | A number that must equal one of the values defined for this prompt. |
| `string_single_choice_prompt` | A string that must equal one of the values defined for this prompt. |
| `number_multi_choice_prompt` | An array of numbers where each number must equal one of the values defined for this prompt. |
| `string_multi_choice_prompt` | An array of strings where each number must equal one of the values defined for this prompt. |
| `text_prompt` | A string with a length that must be within `min` and `max` inclusive if min and max are defined. |
| `timestamp_prompt` | A string that must be one of the [W3C formats](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) of the ISO8601 date-time standard.  |
