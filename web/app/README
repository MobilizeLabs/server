The app directory contains jsp files that contain the necessary html
and javascript to display the AndWellness server side web interface.
login.jsp is the the page a visitor accesses and gives a basic
description of the AndWellness project along with a login box to allow
users to login.  viz.jsp is the main dashboard webpage and contains
javascript to allow the user to view and interact with their data.
The final pages are miscellaneous webpages to cleanly display errors
as they come up (404, etc).


login.jsp 

Imports the main css code in dashboard.css.  Has a banner, main,
control, and footer div.  Has a short description of the AndWellness
application and has a login form that sends login information to
'/app/login'


viz.jsp

The main dashboard page for AndWellness.  Uses the same banner, main,
control, and footer div layout as login.jsp.  Imports a number of
thirdparty and custom css and javascript pages for various dashboard
creation and formatting.


GLOBALS: 

startDate - A global Date to hold the requested start date.  Only
  modified from the send_json_request function which gets the data
  from the input in the grabDateForm.  Accessed in various places for
  formatting and display reasons.

numDays - A global int to hold the number of days of data to display.
  Only modified from the send_json_reqest function which gets the data
  from the input in grabDateForm.  Access in various places for data
  display.

dashBoard - A global DashBoard to hold the main DashBoard class.
  Coordinates actions by requesting data in response to user input,
  and coordinating the return of data.  Should be a Singleton.

userName - A global string set by JSP to hold the name of the logged
  in user.  Is passed to the global DashBoard, then never access or
  changed again.

log - The log used by viz.jsp.  Initialized by calling log4javascript.


IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS:

$() - Called by jQuery after the initial document is done loading.
  All initialization of the webpage is done here.  This function sets
  up the logger for debugging, sets up the datepicker calendar in the
  controls (should be moved into the dashboard), and sends the initial
  request for data (so the dashboard is not blank).

send_json_request_init() - Sends the initial request for data to
  initialize the dashboard with the users from which we can grab data.

send_json_request() - Linked to the grabDateForm form.  Grabs the
  inputted data from grabDateForm, validates, then sends out a request
  for all types of data.  Modifies both the startDate and numDays
  globals.
